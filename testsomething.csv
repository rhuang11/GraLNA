"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(Dollars in thousands)
General Overview
We report our activities in four business segments: Inventory and Logistic Services; Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul; Manufacturing; and Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing.
Sales in the Inventory and Logistic Services segment are derived from the sale of a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to the commercial aviation and military markets, as well as the distribution of new airframe parts purchased from various original equipment manufacturers and sold to commercial and general aviation customers. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product (primarily aircraft and engine parts) and overhead (primarily indirect labor, facility cost and insurance).
Sales in the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment are derived from the repair and overhaul of a wide range of commercial and military aircraft engine and airframe parts, landing gear and components; aircraft maintenance and storage; and the repair, overhaul and sale of parts for industrial gas and steam turbine operators. Cost of sales consists principally of cost of product (primarily replacement aircraft parts), direct labor and overhead.
Sales in the Manufacturing segment are derived from the manufacture and sale of a wide array of containers, pallets and shelters used to support the U.S. Military's tactical deployment requirements, in-plane cargo loading and handling systems for commercial and military applications and advanced composite materials and components for aerospace and industrial use. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product, direct labor and overhead.
Sales in the Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing segment are derived from the sale and lease of commercial aircraft and engines and technical and advisory services. Cost of sales consists principally of cost of product (aircraft and engines), labor and the cost of lease revenue (primarily depreciation, lease expense and insurance).
The table below sets forth consolidated sales for our four business segments for each of the last three fiscal years ended May 31.
As a result of the events of September 11, 2001, which occurred at a time when the worldwide commercial airline environment was already under significant pressure principally due to an economic downturn, most of the major U.S. based commercial airlines announced substantial reductions in capacity, some in excess of 20%. Commercial airlines accelerated their older generation aircraft fleet retirement plans. The reduction in industry-capacity and the financial impact of the events of September 11, 2001 on our customers had a significant negative effect on our fiscal 2002 sales and operating results as demand declined for our products and services within the Inventory and Logistic Services, Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul and Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing segments.
During fiscal 2003, airline traffic began to strengthen and it appeared that the beginning of the airline industry recovery was underway. However, during the third quarter of fiscal 2003, demand for products and services from many of our airline customers weakened as a result of the war in Iraq and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). During fiscal 2003, sales of products and services to the U.S. Government, its agencies and its contractors increased primarily due to increased U.S. Military activity.
During fiscal 2004, sales of our manufactured products and performance-based logistics and supply chain management services continued to increase as a result of the U.S. Military's buildup and increased demand for supply chain management services. Although it is very difficult for us to predict the extent and duration of the military buildup and its impact on our near-term results, we believe that we are well positioned with our current products and services and growth plans to benefit from longer-term U.S. Military deployment and program-management strategies. Total sales to the U.S. Government and its contractors for fiscal 2004 were $222,558, an increase of 30.8% compared to fiscal 2003, and represented 34.1% of fiscal 2004 consolidated sales.
During fiscal 2004, there have been positive signs the airline industry is improving, such as year-over-year improvement in available seat miles, revenue passenger miles and load factors. However, rising fuel prices and high labor costs continue to threaten the commercial airline industry, and recently certain major U.S. carriers warned they may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection. Low cost carriers with little or no infrastructure to support their maintenance requirements have gained market share from the major U.S. carriers. Certain of these low cost carriers are flying newer aircraft which will generate demand for maintenance in future years. We anticipate a fundamental shift in the way our airline customers manage their business, including intensified focus on cost control and increased use of third-party maintenance providers. We believe we are well positioned with our broad range of products and services as these trends develop.
Factors Which May Affect Future Results
Our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected or fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of general economic conditions, geo-political events, the commercial airline environment and other factors, including: (1) declining demand for our products and services and the ability of our customers to meet their financial obligations; (2) declining market values for aviation products and equipment; (3) difficulties in re-leasing or selling aircraft and engines that are currently being leased; (4) lack of assurance that sales to the U.S. Government, its agencies and its contractors (which were 34.1% of total sales in fiscal 2004), will continue at levels previously experienced; (5) access to the debt and equity capital markets and the ability to draw down funds under financing agreements; (6) non-compliance with restrictive and financial covenants contained in certain of our loan agreements; (7) changes in or non-compliance with laws and regulations that may affect certain of our aviation related activities that are subject to licensing, certification and other regulatory requirements imposed by the FAA and other regulatory agencies, both domestic and foreign; (8) competition from other companies, including original equipment manufacturers, some of which have greater financial resources than us; (9) exposure to product liability and property claims that may be in excess of our substantial liability insurance coverage; and (10) the outcome of any pending or future material litigation or environmental proceedings.
Results of Operations
Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003
Consolidated sales for fiscal 2004 were $651,958, which represents an increase of $45,621 or 7.5% compared to fiscal 2003.
In the Inventory and Logistic Services segment, fiscal 2004 sales increased $7,927 or 3.2% compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in sales compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to higher sales to the U.S. Military and its contractors for spares and logistics support and increased sales of engine parts. In the Inventory and Logistic Services segment, we experienced lower sales of parts to general aviation customers as a result of our strategic decision to de-emphasize certain lower margin products. Going forward, we will continue our strategy of focusing on the distribution of higher margin products.,No,"Based on the MDA section, determine if the financial statements are misstated or contain signs of fraudulent activities.
